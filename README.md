# EntropyVisualizer
Arduino equipped with a gas meter, temperature/humidity sensor, sound meter, display, and LED strip. It uses sensor data to generate randomness, visualizes it with colors on the LED strip, and outputs a random long unsigned integer via its serial interface, which can be read in to try to get close to true randomness.
